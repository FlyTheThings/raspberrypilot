Working on Ground:

When opening the .pro file in ground in Qt Creator go to project build settings and change the build directory to be ../build/ground

You now need python and git in your path



Bad Changers to get it running:
dumped the boot loader, for now
really stripped out board config as it now is running on a stm32fdiscovery board
